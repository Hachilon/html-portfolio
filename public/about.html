<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is Hachi and Coco.  Hachi is an all white male American Akita.  Hachi was born on Thursday, May 5th, 2013.  Hachi is a very sweet and kind dog, so kind that when his little Chihuahua brother, Coco, showed up, he welcomed him with open arms.  Hachi was so sweet natured that he tolerated all of Coco's antics, including making himself comfortable sitting on Hachi's back. I wonder who the Alpha dog is in this picture?.</p>

<p>Coco showed up to the house by surprise.  He was so small, just skin and bones, weighing less than 5 pounds.  He was so sweet and innocent, boy did he fool us.  Once Coco became comfortable in the house, he crowned himself king of the castle.  He has been in charge ever since.</p>

<p> What is nice to see is how the feared Akita is docile and sweet and patient to play games with his little brother and how Coco loves to play games with Hachi. Those were good time that were enjoyed by all..</p>
